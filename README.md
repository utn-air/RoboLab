**RoboLab** is a task-based evaluation benchmark for robot manipulation policies built on [NVIDIA Isaac Lab](https://github.com/isaac-sim/IsaacLab). It provides 100+ manipulation tasks with automated success detection, a server-client policy architecture, and multi-environment parallel evaluation — designed for reproducible, large-scale benchmarking of generalist robot policies in simulation.

## Key Features

- **RoboLab-120**: An initial set of 120 brand new benchmark [tasks](robolab/tasks/README.md) spanning pick-and-place, stacking, rearrangement, tool use, and more — each with language instructions and automated success/failure detection via composable predicates.
- **Bring your own robot**: Tasks are not tied to a specific robot embodiment, so you can plug in any robot compatible with IsaacLab!
- **Rich Asset Libraries**: See a list of [objects](assets/objects/README.md), [scenes](assets/scenes/README.md), and curated [backgrounds](assets/backgrounds/README.md) — everything you need to create new scenes and new tasks for your own evaluation needs.
- **AI-Enabled Workflows**: Generate new scenes and tasks **in minutes** using natural language with the [/robolab-scenegen](skills/robolab-scenegen/) and [/robolab-taskgen](skills/robolab-taskgen/) Claude Code skills.
- **Multi-Environment Parallel Evaluation**: Run multiple episodes in parallel across environments with vectorized conditionals and per-environment termination.
- **Server-Client Policy Architecture**: Policy models run as standalone servers; RoboLab connects via lightweight inference clients (OpenPI, GR00T, and more).

## Getting Started

Requires [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/). Isaac Sim 5.0 and Isaac Lab 2.2.0 are installed automatically via `uv sync`. See [Requirements](#requirements) for hardware.

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NVlabs/RoboLab.git
cd robolab
uv venv --python 3.11
source .venv/bin/activate
uv sync
```

On first run, Isaac Sim prompts you to accept the NVIDIA Omniverse EULA. Either accept it interactively, or set it once in your shell:
```bash
export OMNI_KIT_ACCEPT_EULA=Y
```

> **Running without activating the venv**: if you don't `source .venv/bin/activate`, prefix every `python` command with `uv run` (e.g. `uv run python scripts/check_registered_envs.py`).

Verify installation:
```bash
python scripts/check_registered_envs.py
```

### Run without a policy

```bash
# Run an empty episode with random actions
python examples/demo/run_empty.py --headless

# Playback recorded demonstration data
python examples/demo/run_recorded.py --headless
```

### Run with a policy

RoboLab uses a **server-client architecture**: your model runs as a standalone server, and RoboLab connects to it via a lightweight inference client. To quickly test RoboLab, try [Pi0-5 via OpenPI](docs/inference.md#openpi-pi0--pi0-fast--pi05).

Each inference client has its own lightweight Python dependency — e.g. Pi0 / Pi0-fast / Pi05 need `openpi-client`, which is **not** installed by `uv sync`. Install only the client(s) you need; see [docs/inference.md](docs/inference.md) for each backend. For example, to use the Pi0 family:
```bash
# Clone the OpenPI repo separately and install its client into the RoboLab venv
git clone git@github.com:xuningy/openpi.git ../openpi
uv pip install -e ../openpi/packages/openpi-client
```

1. Start your policy server in a separate terminal.
2. Run evaluation:
   ```bash
   python examples/policy/run_eval.py --policy pi05 --task BananaInBowlTask --num-envs 12 --headless
   ```
3. Analyze results:
   ```bash
   python analysis/read_results.py output/<your_run_folder>
   ```

### Common CLI Options

```bash
# Run on specific tasks (these two are good for sanity checking)
python examples/policy/run_eval.py --policy pi05 --task BananaInBowlTask RubiksCubeAndBananaTask

# Run on a tag of tasks
python examples/policy/run_eval.py --policy pi05 --tag semantics

# Run 12 parallel episodes per task
python examples/policy/run_eval.py --policy pi05 --headless --num-envs 12

# Enable subtask progress tracking
python examples/policy/run_eval.py --policy pi05 --headless --enable-subtask

# Resume a previous run (skips completed episodes)
python examples/policy/run_eval.py --policy pi05 --output-folder-name my_previous_run
```
