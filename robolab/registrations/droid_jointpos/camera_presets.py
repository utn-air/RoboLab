Droid-specific camera preset bundles for the policy's image observations.

Each preset is a list of camera config classes that feed both the scene
(``camera_cfg=``) and the image observation group (via
``generate_image_obs_from_cameras``). Viewport-only cameras (e.g., the
third-person mirrored view used for video recording) are attached separately
inside the registration function and are not listed here.

Callers pass one of these lists directly to the registration function:

    from robolab.registrations.droid_jointpos.camera_presets import WRIST_LEFT_RIGHT_HEAD
    auto_register_droid_envs(cameras=WRIST_LEFT_RIGHT_HEAD)
