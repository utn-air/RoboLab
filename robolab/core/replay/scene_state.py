"""Scene-state restore and validation against recorded episodes.

``restore_recorded_initial_state`` puts the scene in the exact state a
recording started from, so an open-loop action replay evolves the same way the
recording did. ``StateValidator`` measures how closely a replay tracks the
recorded per-step states — a debug tool that turns "the replay diverged" from
a guess into a measurement.
