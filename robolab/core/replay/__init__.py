"""Faithful playback of recorded episodes.

Everything replay needs beyond the recorded actions lives here, organized by
what is being restored or checked (see ``docs/replay.md`` for the user guide):

- :mod:`~robolab.core.replay.env_config` — load the ``env_cfg.json`` recorded
  next to an episode and overlay it onto a freshly built env config, so replay
  uses the exact recorded config values rather than the current repo's task
  definitions.
- :mod:`~robolab.core.replay.scene_state` — reset the scene to the recorded
  initial state, and validate per-step sim state against the recorded states.

For warning when the current IsaacSim/IsaacLab stack differs from the one an
episode was recorded on, see
:func:`robolab.core.utils.version_utils.warn_on_stack_mismatch`.

Typical driver flow:

    env_cfg = parse_env_cfg(task, ...)
    recorded, path = load_recorded_env_cfg(hdf5_path)
    apply_recorded_env_cfg(env_cfg, recorded)
    env, _ = create_env(env_cfg, ...)
    restore_recorded_initial_state(env, hdf5_path, episode)
    # step recorded actions open-loop; StateValidator.check_step() per step
"""
